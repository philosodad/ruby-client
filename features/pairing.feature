    When the user pairs with BitPay with a valid pairing code
    And tokens will be saved locally

  Scenario: there is no local keyfile
    Given that there is no local keyfile
    When the user pairs with BitPay with a valid pairing code
    Then the keyfile will be saved locally
    And tokens will be saved locally

  Scenario: the client has a bad pairing code
    Given the user fails to pair with a semantically valid code "a1b2c3d"

  Scenario: the client has an incorrect pairing code
    Given the user fails to pair with a semantically invalid code "a2b2c3d4"
    Then they will recieve a BitPay::ArgumentError matching "pairing code is not legal" 

  Scenario: the client has a bad port configuration to a closed port
    Given that there is a local keyfile
